● Your name
Omar Sanchez

● A fun fact about yourself
I'm learning how to fly a homemade quadcopter drone

● Anyone with whom you worked with on the assignment (see note above)
Project worked on alone

● Indication of which uninformed search method you implemented
Breadth First Search was used for as the uninformed search method

● Description of the heuristic you used for A*
manhattan distance - sum of absolute distances between x and y coords from current state to goal state for every puzzle piece

● A short (2-3 sentence) summary of findings from examining the performance metrics on different test cases.
A* always showed better performance metrics than breadth first search. A* had a substantially lesser amount of nodes added to the frontier

● Instructions for running each program (a sample command line for each should suffice)

Breadth First Search - java uninformedSearch.java "File Directory"
A* - java AStarSearch.java "File Directory"
Greedy Search - java GreedySearch.java "File Directory"
