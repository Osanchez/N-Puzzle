# Assignment
Solving the N-puzzle Problem with Search
You will be writing a solver for the n-puzzle problem using different search strategies. In class,
we talked about the 8-puzzle, which consists of eight tiles on a 3x3 grid, with an open square.
The goal state consists of the open square in the upper left, with the other tiles arranged in
numeric order from left to right.
Valid moves are Up, Down, Left, and Right, which
shift a tile into the open square (though, depending
on the position of the open square, not all of those
moves may be available).
Your solver must take a start state as input, and
perform a search over the state space, and return a
solution (when possible). In addition, your program will track the efficiency of the search
process and report back performance metrics.
